This is a simple HTML project that will allow you to manually enter your monthly bills and generate a PDF file for tracking. 

You can go to https://arseliealaine.github.io/mymonthlybilltracker/ to use it as is.

If you'd like to modify the code and tailor the details according to your needs, please feel free to download the index.html file to your desktop. 

Planned Changes:
- Add Bill Month to the PDF file to be exported
- Add a field that will allow you to track your payments (e.g. to be able to put payment reference numbers, etc.)
